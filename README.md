# userscript-experiment-01

This is a project in which I'm going to be figuring out userscripts, and basic to advanced webhacks.
Please contribute, and possibly help me along a little bit because I *SUCK* at coding right now.
Literally my best work is just an image of a duck moving across a screen.
Depressing, right?
Anyways, I'm going to occasionally check in on/contribute to this repository, so y'all don't go thinking that I'm dead or something.
